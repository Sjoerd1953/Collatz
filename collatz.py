Version history:
    1.0 Initial version
    1.1 Names of functions in line with official terminology
        Reduced sequence added
    1.2 Added colgen(n) (Collatz sequence generator)
        Added redcolgen(n) (Collatz reduced sequence generator)
        C(n), T(n) and tst(n) are now using the generators
